# âœ¨ Vibe Onchain âœ¨

 âœ¨ Vibe Onchain âœ¨ is an opinionated, LLM friendly fork of Scaffold-Alchemy, which is based off ScaffoldETH, a popular starter project to build onchain apps on Ethereum. Think of Vibe onchain is the cheat code, yolo mode to build an onchain app fast on an ethereum testnet. You can get started immediately NextJS, TypeScript, Hardhat, AccountKit, Enhanced APIs and Subgraphs ðŸ¤© 
 
 Vibe Onchain uses Base L2 (Sepolia), but can use mostly any other L2. Uniquely, it includes a /docs folder with much of Alchemy's documentation and APIs, as well as a placeholder for you to include instructions for your app build (see below). Bring this repo it into your favoriate AI powered IDE and build insanely fast.

## Requirements

Before you begin, you will need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v22.0)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with âœ¨ Vibe Onchain âœ¨, follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repo

2. Open your code in an AI-powered coding tool, like cursor or windsurf. 

3. In a new terminal, from your project's main directory, install dependencies:

```
yarn
```

4. Start your app:

```
yarn start
```

5. Visit your app webpage & login

6. Once you login, find an app you want to build, and copy the instructions.

7. Paste the instructions text in the /docs/instructions.txt file. Read through it, make any changes you would like. 

7. Start a new chat with your coding agent and paste: "execute on the instructions.txt file". Of course you can modify this prompt if you want.

7. Build build build. Iterate with AI until you find what you like. When you are ready to deploy, simply use:
